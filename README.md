Bingo is a simple Bingo caller desktop app. The main difference is it also displays the next number that will be called. It also reads the number, using the OS voice.

## How to run and build
Download [Xojo 2022r2 or higher](https://xojo.com/download/), press the Run button if you want to debug the application, or the Build button (you'll need a Xojo license) for creating an executable that you can share.
